For this task, I used **Python** along with the **Pandas** library for reading and analyzing data, and the **FPDF** library to generate a formatted PDF report. The platform used was a standard Python development environment, which can be easily replicated using tools like **VS Code**, **Jupyter Notebook**, or **Google Colab** From this task, I learned how to automate the process of reading structured data, analyzing it to extract meaningful statistics, and converting that information into a clean, professional-looking PDF report. It demonstrated the power of Python in simplifying repetitive reporting tasks and turning raw data into readable summaries.
